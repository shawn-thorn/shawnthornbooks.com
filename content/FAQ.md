# Frequently Asked Questions 

### How many children can attend?
The presentation is suitable for groups as small as 20 and as large as 150 -- though the smaller the group, the more interactive the presentation. Smaller venues give more children an opportunity to be a part of the Q&A.

### Do you charge a fee for author visits?

Yes, like most published authors, there's a reasonable and competitive fee for school visits. Please send an email if you're interested in booking a visit. 

### What grades are appropriate for an author visit?

Shawn's children's books are picture books, so preschool and elementary aged students are appropriate. Shawn is putting the final touches on his fantasy fiction novel (ages 10-16).  Children of all ages will benefit from an author visit. 

### Do you offer a discount?

Unfortunately, Shawn does not offer a discount. His prices are fair and competitive. An author's rates can't be translated into hourly fees. When a school pays for an author visit, they are investing in the years of knowledge and skill they amassed. Not only does a school compensate the author for the work he does that day, but all the preparation that went into the presentations beforehand, the time spent traveling to and from the school, and the author's time away from their writing desk. An author visit isn't just an event, it's an experience, one that takes time and preparation to get it just right.

### Is there a minimum book sales with your visit? 

No, book sales are not required. Shawn will provide forms and information that librarians and teachers can hand out to their students before his arrival. Librarians, teachers and parents have an opportunity to purchase a book and send it to school with the student to get an autograph. 

### How far in advance should I book an author visit?

Two weeks if possible, although 2 months in advance is ideal. This gives an ample amount of time to organize and inform parents and children.

Shawn Thorn, a Canadian Author, lives in beautiful Vancouver, BC. Shawn began working with children in a daycare setting at the age of fifteen and maintained experience as an elementary teacher, learning and behavioural specialist, youth worker, and twenty-five years later, he has had hands-on experience working with children who have been diagnosed with a variety of pervasive disorders, such as Autism, FASD, ADHD and ODD. 

​​​​​​​​Shawn has been writing for many years, although it isn't until 2017 that he decided to open his vault and publish his first of many stories, Don't Tease Mr. Beeze. He's enjoying his new journey by visiting multiple elementary schools, bookstores, festivals, and reading to a group of children.

He has a love for nature and the outdoors. From canoeing in BC to visiting bird sanctuaries in Delta.
